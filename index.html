    <p> This is the class site of Andy Caress for the summer semester of <a href="https://handmade-web.net/summer20/"> Handmade Web </a> with <a href="https://aidanquinlan.net/"> Aidan Quinlan. </a> </p>

      <p2> OVERVIEW: <br> </p2>
      The hand has become increasingly less present in the web as we know it today. Websites are automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few. It has only gotten easier to learn
      and make on the web, but the idea and perceived requirements for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject. This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize the hand-quality of websites by developing
      an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and present context of the web. We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative
      space.
      <br><br>
      The websites we will make may be small, but their hearts will be big.
      <br><br>
      The first half of the class will be technically focused. It will comprise of a series of lessons, readings, workshops, and small projects to develop familiarity and
      confidence with the language of the web. We will focus on the basic languages of web development: HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript. This class is designed for students with no programming experience at all, but should be friendly to any skill
      level. The second half will be focused on a larger project website.
